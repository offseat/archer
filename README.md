# Archer theme for silverstripe
reuse the theme how you want to use it.

After setup the sitemanifest file wont be extracted to public folder, either ignore that message or extract the contents of favicon folder to the root of public (** caution here if you don't want to override the default favicon)

Uncomment the the includes in Page.ss to show other page types

`<%-- <% include BlogPage %> --%>`
